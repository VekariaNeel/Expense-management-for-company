#### **components/EmployeeRoute.jsx** (NEW)
Protected route component for employee-only pages:

- Redirects to login if not authenticated
- Shows access denied for non-employees

### 2. Updated Components

#### **App.jsx**
- Added import for `EmployeeRoute` and `EmployeeDashboard`
- Added route: `/employee/dashboard` → EmployeeDashboard (protected by EmployeeRoute)

#### **pages/Login.jsx** (Already Updated)
- Role-based redirect already includes Employee → `/employee/dashboard`

#### **context/AuthContext.jsx** (Already Updated)
- `isEmployee` property already added

## User Flow

### 1. Admin Creates Employee
1. Admin logs in → redirected to `/admin/users`
2. Admin clicks "Add User"
3. Fills form with Employee role and optional manager
4. System generates temporary password (shown in server console)
5. Admin sends password to employee

### 2. Employee First Login
1. Employee receives temporary password
2. Goes to `/login` or `/reset-password`
3. Enters email and temporary password
4. Creates new password
5. Automatically logged in and redirected to `/employee/dashboard`

### 3. Employee Dashboard Usage
1. **Upload Receipts**
   - Click "Upload Receipts" button
   - Select one or more receipt images
   - Receipts added to library

2. **Create Expense**
   - Click "New Expense" button
   - Slide-in drawer opens
   - Fill expense details or attach receipt for auto-fill
   - Save as draft or submit for approval

3. **Manage Expenses**
   - View all expenses in table
   - Click row to edit
   - Filter by status
   - Search and sort
   - Track submission status

4. **Receipt OCR (Mock)**
   - Attach receipt from library
   - System extracts amount, date, description from filename
   - Auto-fills form fields
   - User can modify before submitting

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect, useMemo)
- Local state for expenses and receipts (mock data)
- Form state management with controlled inputs
- Drawer state for slide-in panel

### File Upload
- HTML5 File API for receipt uploads
- FileReader for converting to data URLs
- Multiple file selection support
- Preview thumbnails in grid layout

### Mock OCR Logic
- Extracts amount from filename using regex
- Detects date patterns (YYYY-MM-DD or DD-MM-YYYY)
- Generates description from filename
- Fallback to random values if not detected

### Currency Handling
- Multi-currency support (USD, EUR, INR, CAD, GBP, AUD, JPY)
- Currency chips in summary cards
- Intl.NumberFormat for proper formatting
- Fallback formatting for unsupported currencies

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Responsive grid layouts
- Drawer adapts to screen size
- Table with horizontal scroll on mobile

## File Structure

```
admin/frontend/src/
├── App.jsx (modified - added employee route)
├── components/
│   └── EmployeeRoute.jsx (NEW)
└── pages/
    └── EmployeeDashboard.jsx (NEW)
```

## API Integration (Future)

Currently using mock data. To integrate with real API:

1. **Fetch Expenses**
   - GET `/api/expenses` - Get employee's expenses
   - Filter by employee ID from auth context

2. **Create/Update Expense**
   - POST `/api/expenses` - Create new expense
   - PUT `/api/expenses/:id` - Update existing expense

3. **Upload Receipt**
   - POST `/api/receipts` - Upload receipt image
   - Returns receipt ID to attach to expense

4. **Submit for Approval**
   - PUT `/api/expenses/:id/submit` - Change status to "Waiting Approval"
   - Triggers notification to manager

5. **Get Receipt**
   - GET `/api/receipts/:id` - Download receipt image
