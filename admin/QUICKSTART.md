## Testing Tips

### Sample Test Data

```
Email: admin@techcorp.com
Password: Admin123!
```

**Add Sample Users:**
1. Jane Manager (Manager role)
2. Bob Employee (Employee role, Manager: Jane)
3. Alice Employee (Employee role, Manager: Jane)

**Configure Approval Rules:**
- For Bob: Manager = Jane, Approvers = [Jane, Alice], Sequential, 100%
- For Alice: Manager = Jane, Approvers = [Jane, Bob], Parallel, 50%

## Common Issues

### Backend won't start
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Make sure you ran `npm install` in the backend directory
- Verify `.env` file exists (copy from `.env.example`)

### Frontend won't start
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Make sure you ran `npm install` in the frontend directory
- Clear browser cache and restart

### API errors
- Ensure backend is running on port 5000
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify JWT token is being sent (check Network tab)

### Data disappeared
- This is expected! Data is stored in-memory and resets when you restart the backend server
- You'll need to signup again after restarting

## Development Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm start          # Start server
npm run dev        # Start with nodemon (auto-restart)
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
```

## API Testing with curl

### Signup
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "companyName": "Test Corp",
    "country": "United States",
    "currency": "USD",
    "adminName": "Admin User",
    "adminEmail": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "Test123!",
    "confirmPassword": "Test123!"
  }'
```

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@test.com",
    "password": "Test123!"
  }'
```

### Get Users (requires JWT token)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

## Next Steps

After setting up the admin functionality, you can extend the system with:
- Expense submission pages
- Approval workflow execution
- Reports and analytics
- Database integration
- Email service integration
